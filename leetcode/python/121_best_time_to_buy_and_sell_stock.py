# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

# If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

# Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

# Example 1:

# Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 1, 4, 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
# Â             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
